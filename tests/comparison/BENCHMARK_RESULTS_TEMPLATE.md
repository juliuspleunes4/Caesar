## Methodology

### Test Environment
- **OS**: [Operating System]
- **CPU**: [Processor Information]
- **RAM**: [Memory Information]
- **Compiler**: [C++ Compiler Version]
- **Python**: [Python Version]

### Measurement Approach
- Each test run 1,000 times for statistical validity
- Results averaged with standard deviation calculated
- Outliers removed using statistical filtering
- Memory usage measured separately where applicable

### Fair Comparison Guidelines
- Identical algorithms across all languages
- No language-specific optimizations applied
- Standard libraries only (no specialized packages)
- Output suppressed to avoid I/O timing effects
