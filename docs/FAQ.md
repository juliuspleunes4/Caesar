# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is Caesar?

Caesar is a Python-like programming language designed to combine Python's elegant syntax with C++'s performance. It features a complete implementation including lexer, parser, and interpreter, built from the ground up in modern C++.

### Why create another programming language?

Caesar was created to explore the full spectrum of language design and implementation. It serves as:
- **Educational tool**: Demonstrates compiler construction techniques
- **Performance research**: Investigates optimization strategies for dynamic languages
- **Innovation platform**: Tests new language features and design patterns

### How does Caesar compare to Python?

| Feature | Caesar | Python |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Syntax** | Python-like, clean and readable | Clean and readable |
| **Performance** | C++ speed (compiled) | Interpreted (slower) |
| **Ecosystem** | Growing (v1.1.0) | Massive, mature |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy (Python-familiar) | Easy |
| **Use Cases** | Performance-critical apps | General purpose |

### Is Caesar production-ready?

Caesar v1.1.0 is suitable for:
- ✅ **Learning and education**: Excellent for teaching programming concepts
- ✅ **Prototyping**: Quick algorithm development and testing
- ✅ **Performance experiments**: Benchmarking and optimization research
- ⚠️ **Production systems**: Limited ecosystem, use with caution

For production use, consider Caesar for specific use cases where Python syntax + C++ performance is crucial.

### What platforms does Caesar support?

Currently supported:
- ✅ **Windows** (primary development platform)
- ✅ **Linux** (via CMake build system)
- ✅ **macOS** (via CMake build system)

## Technical Questions

### How fast is Caesar compared to Python?

Caesar is compiled to native code, providing significant performance improvements:
- **Arithmetic operations**: 10-50x faster than Python
- **Loop-heavy code**: 20-100x faster than Python
- **Function calls**: 5-20x faster than Python

*Note: Benchmarks vary by use case. Python's extensive C extensions can close the gap for specific tasks.*

### What Python features are supported?

**Currently Supported (v1.1.0):**
```python
# Variables and basic data types
x = 42
name = "Caesar"
is_ready = True

# Control flow
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

# Loops
for i in range(10):
    print(i)

while x > 0:
    x -= 1

# Functions
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Built-in functions
print(len("hello"))
print(type(42))
```

**Coming Soon (v1.2.0):**
- Lists: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Dictionaries: `{"key": "value"}`
- String methods: `"hello".upper()`

**Future Versions:**
- Classes and inheritance
- Exception handling (try/catch)
- Modules and imports

### Can I use Python libraries with Caesar?

Not currently. Caesar is a separate language implementation and cannot directly import Python libraries. However, we're planning:

- **v2.0+**: Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for C/C++ libraries
- **Future**: Python interoperability layer

### How do I install Caesar?

**Option 1: Download Release (Recommended)**
1. Visit [Caesar Releases](https://github.com/juliuspleunes4/Caesar/releases)
2. Download `caesar-v1.1.0-windows.zip` (or your platform)
3. Extract and run `caesar.exe`

**Option 2: Build from Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliuspleunes4/Caesar.git
cd Caesar
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed installation help.

### How do I run Caesar programs?

```bash
# Interactive mode (REPL)
caesar

# Run a file
caesar program.csr
