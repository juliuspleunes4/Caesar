### Example Report Template

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Caesar Programming Language - Buffer Overflow in Parser

Description:
A potential buffer overflow exists in the parser when processing extremely long identifier names.

Impact:
This could potentially allow arbitrary code execution when processing malicious .csr files.

Reproduction Steps:
1. Create a .csr file with an identifier name longer than 10,000 characters
2. Run: caesar --interpret malicious.csr
3. Observe crash/unexpected behavior

Environment:
- OS: Windows 10 64-bit
- Caesar Version: 1.1.0
- Compiler: MSVC 2022

Proof of Concept:
[Attach minimal example or describe specific input that triggers the issue]
```

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Within 1 week
- **Fix Development:** Within 2-4 weeks (depending on complexity)
- **Patch Release:** As soon as fix is tested and verified

## Security Considerations

### Language Design Security

Caesar is designed with security in mind:

- **Memory Safety:** Modern C++17 with RAII and smart pointers
- **Input Validation:** Robust parsing with bounds checking
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling without crashes
- **No Unsafe Operations:** No direct memory manipulation in Caesar code

### Potential Security Areas

Areas where security issues might occur:

1. **Parser Vulnerabilities**
   - Malformed input causing crashes
   - Memory exhaustion through deeply nested structures
   - Buffer overflows in string processing

2. **Interpreter Security**
   - Infinite loops or recursion (DoS)
   - Memory leaks in long-running programs
   - File system access restrictions

3. **Build System Security**
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
   - Malicious build scripts
   - Compromised toolchain

### Safe Usage Guidelines

For users of Caesar:

1. **Validate Input Sources**
   - Only run Caesar programs from trusted sources
   - Review code before execution, especially from unknown authors

2. **Resource Limits**
   - Monitor memory usage for long-running programs
   - Set timeouts for program execution if needed

3. **Sandboxing**
   - Consider running untrusted Caesar programs in sandboxed environments
   - Limit file system access for untrusted code

4. **Keep Updated**
   - Use the latest version of Caesar
   - Apply security updates promptly

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Report Reception** - We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation** - We investigate and assess the severity
3. **Fix Development** - We develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure Coordination** - We coordinate disclosure with the reporter
5. **Public Disclosure** - We publicly disclose after fix is available

### Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve Caesar's security:

- **Security Acknowledgments** - Credit in release notes and documentation
- **Hall of Fame** - Recognition on our website (if you wish)
- **Priority Support** - Fast-tracked responses for future reports

## Security Updates

### Release Process

Security updates follow this process:

1. **Patch Development** - Fix is developed and tested
2. **Version Numbering** - Patch version increment (e.g., 1.1.0 â†’ 1.1.1)
3. **Release Notes** - Clear description of security fix
4. **User Notification** - Security advisory published
5. **Distribution** - Updated packages released immediately

### Staying Informed

To stay informed about security updates:

- **Watch** our GitHub repository for releases
- **Subscribe** to release notifications
- **Check** the security advisories section regularly
- **Follow** our social media for urgent announcements

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

If you're contributing to Caesar:

### Code Review Focus Areas

1. **Input Validation**
   ```cpp
   // Always validate input bounds
   if (input.length() > MAX_IDENTIFIER_LENGTH) {
       throw std::invalid_argument("Identifier too long");
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Management**
   ```cpp
   // Use smart pointers, avoid raw pointers
   std::unique_ptr<ASTNode> node = std::make_unique<LiteralExpression>(value);
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```cpp
   // Handle errors gracefully, don't crash
   try {
       parseExpression();
   } catch (const std::exception& e) {
       reportError("Parse error: " + std::string(e.what()));
       return nullptr;
   }
   ```

### Testing Security

- **Fuzzing** - Test with malformed/random input
- **Boundary Testing** - Test edge cases and limits
- **Resource Testing** - Test memory and CPU usage limits
- **Error Path Testing** - Ensure error conditions are handled safely

## Threat Model

### Assumed Trust Model

- **Trusted:** Caesar compiler/interpreter binaries
- **Semi-Trusted:** Caesar source code from known contributors
- **Untrusted:** Caesar programs from unknown sources
- **Untrusted:** User input to Caesar programs

### Attack Vectors

Potential attack vectors we consider:

1. **Malicious Caesar Programs**
   - Infinite loops or resource exhaustion
   - Exploiting parser vulnerabilities
   - Social engineering through deceptive code

2. **Supply Chain Attacks**
   - Compromised dependencies
   - Malicious build tools
   - Man-in-the-middle attacks on downloads

3. **Local Privilege Escalation**
   - Exploiting file system permissions
   - Buffer overflows leading to code execution

### Mitigations

Our security mitigations include:

- **Modern C++** - Memory-safe language features
- **Static Analysis** - Code quality tools and linting
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, stress tests
- **Code Review** - All changes reviewed by maintainers
- **Dependency Management** - Regular updates and security scanning
